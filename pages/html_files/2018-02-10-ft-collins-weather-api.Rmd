If everything is running correctly, each time you open this page, the image above will refresh with the lastest weather for the past two days in Ft. Collins. 

I'll be writing up full details on how to create an API with the ```plumber``` package as well as using Docker to create containers to run the API in. 

Check it out yourself by changing the ```days``` parameter

```

Until then, cheers!
