<p>I’ve changed the names of the people in here because I do not want anyone who might know the individual to read what I consider to be a brutal account of their loved ones death. For those that don’t know, I was a trauma nurse in the Army before spending most of my time researching and learning about data and mathematics.</p>
<p>I don’t believe everything happens for a reason. If that were the case, Jake would still be walking the Earth today; home with his then 3 year old son celebrating life with the rest of us. Though I’m not sure where to start, I want to make it clear that this is not a pity-party for myself, nor do I care for any personal attention. Jake was a great man, a soldier whom would rather starve than see his buddy go without eating.</p>
<p>We were located in Kunar Province, Afghanistan, northeast of Jalalabad and a morning’s jog from the Pakistani border. Bin Laden once found refuge in the area, running the caves of the Hindu Kush Mountains. Kunar was also the place of death for 19 Americans during Operation Red Wing; the greatest daily loss of Navy SEALs before the events of August 16, 2011 where 22 other SEALs were killed. Four months before we arrived, minutes from our location, another eight soldiers lost their lives and 22 more were wounded during the Battle of Kamdesh. These men were surrounded at Combat Outpost Keating, where high ground on each side of the American’s position made a tactical advantage for the Taliban. Over 300 insurgents surrounded the small outpost, not much larger than a moderate sized parking lot. The men held this position, considered irrelevant to command, and were planning to fully withdraw from Keating only days before the attack.</p>
<p>I was a nurse with the Army’s 555th Forward Surgical Team, a nine man outfit with two general surgeons, one nurse anesthetist, two medics, two ICU/ER nurses, an OR Nurse, and two operating room technicians. We were located at Forward Operating Base Bostick, a makeshift hospital that treated these wounded men and prepared the remains of our dead known as “heroes” for their voyage home. Though our primary mission was to support the war-fighters by treating all injuries related to loss of life, limb, or eyesight, villagers from the local Pashto tribes asked for medical help and we often took them in as part of a humanitarian effort in the region.</p>
<p>We arrived on a February night and were unable to see the surrounding terrain until first light of morning. I was surprised at how dark this place was. There was no light pollution that is commonly seen in a modern community. The base required that all visible light be turned off at night. Before I was aware of my surroundings, I often walked straight into a wall or flagpole concealed by darkness. Any source of light was prohibited at night to prevent enemy fighters from using this environmental target to fire mortars down upon our outpost. When I woke up to view the sunrise on the first morning, I was overwhelmed by my surroundings. We were located in a green valley with mountains on each side of the FOB with a river flowing in a southeastern direction. It felt like being at the bottom of a living, breathing version of the Grand Canyon. If you threw a rock outside the eastern part of the FOB you would hit Pakistan, while to the North were the snow-capped mountains of Nuristan. This was Indian country, and my fellow soldiers and I were in the thick of it.</p>
<p>Roughly a month into our deployment we began to receive harassment fire from the Pakistani side of our base. The Taliban used the height of the mountains to fire mortars from a far distance and as the months drew on their fire became more frequent and accurate.</p>
<p>In August we were met with our first Mass Casualty Event, which is defined as any amount of patients that overwhelms the capacity of one or more individuals to care for them. Soldiers from the Afghan National Army had driven their vehicle over an IED and 15 men, loaded into the beds of two Ford Rangers, had suffered substantial injuries and were en-route to our facility. Our small building could hardly hold such a large quantity of patients and we were forced to use the halls and break area for patient care. One man would not survive his injuries as the blast eviscerated his abdomen and lost consciousness from shock before arrival. When I assessed him, I saw that his small intestines had ruptured and were drying in the open air in the back seat of the vehicle and could smell feces. Two other men would lose both legs below the knee and one suffered from increased intracranial pressure which I am assuming was caused by the concussion of the blast. Injuries such as these were common.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until January that I met my greatest challenge and most personal loss of the year. Each checkpoint from the FOB was labeled by its distance, so the checkpoint named, “two point five,” was two and a half kilometers from our compound. A medic and good friend, Michael, was preparing his aid bag for the upcoming mission to this location. Jake along with Michael would depart here on convoy unaware of the events that lay ahead. Controlling the roads of Kunar gave control of critical supply routes. With frequent checkpoints, American forces decreased drug and weapons trafficking by these methods.</p>
<p>On this day I was also completing my daily checks and preparing the ER and ICU for the (always) potential rush of incoming patients. We completed daily equipment checks to prevent unwelcome surprises in the event of an emergency where there is no room for error. When a patient arrives, every aspect of the trauma is controlled and if he should die it must not be on our hands. Michael did the same, selecting gauze, IV’s, fluids and medications he would require in an emergency. As the mission’s hit time approached, Michael left for his designated vehicle. Jake was the gunner for a vehicle. When the day was slow, I was able to listen to radio chatter and as time drew on, the situation at 2.5 began to grow unstable.</p>
<p>With our unit translator present, we often heard Taliban fighters chatting about “corn” and “pigs” which was their code names for weapons and enemy (American) soldiers. The Taliban had eyes on my friends and according to Michael after the event had taken place he was “unable to see which direction the Taliban were located until they fired the first round.” An enemy sniper shot from a cornfield across the river and struck Jake through the right armpit. Soldiers and friends of Jake began to return fire while Michael rushed to aid our fallen friend. His body armor was removed to expose the injury, and he was currently turning white from loss of blood. Michael checked for pulse, assessed his breathing, and discovered his vitals were nonexistent. Michael signaled for another soldier to begin CPR while he initiated an intravenous line and packed the injury with anti-hemorrhagic gauze. Soon after, Michael radioed in a 9 Line Medivac Request which is a message to the nearest hospital facility that there is an injured soldier on the battlefield.</p>
<p>I was shocked to hear that Jake had been hurt, and a flood of emotions circled around in my head. I began to visualize the situation which is a thought that still haunts me to this day. CPR had been initiated, meaning there was a man pumping into his chest, breaking ribs to move what little blood was left inside while another transferred his own oxygen into Jake’s lungs. Michael was pushing fluids through the IV, attempting to get Jake’s blood pressure up all while sitting in the back of an armored vehicle. There is no air conditioning in the MRAP (vehicle they were moving in) and there was less space than a moderate sized closet. Jake was limp, pupils dilated, and quickly bleeding out of his side in a foreign country. A cloud of dust was trailing the vehicle while it moved far too slow, both men inside under the age of 23 battling a separate enemy from the one outside. There was no time to waste, but these two friends were still in a combat zone; precautions would still have to be taken to prevent another casualty from small arms fire or an IED.</p>
<p>Thousands of miles from home, Jake’s three year old son was sleeping, unable to fully understand why his father is away and dreaming of the day he arrives home.</p>
<p>I was already dressed in surgical attire when we were notified that Jake was at the front gate. There was no time to waste in the ER and our surgical team headed directly to the operating room. As the nurse it was my responsibility to initiate the first IV, obtain lab samples and initiate a blood transfusion. Our two surgeons, Majors Hilton and O’Hare were instructing the OR technicians on the appropriate course of action; their plan was to immediately crack Jake’s chest through the left lateral side and repair his heart to return blood flow.</p>
<p>When Jake’s vehicle arrived, Dr. Hilton, our primary surgeon, ran to him and picked up Jake’s lifeless body. Michael, while distressed and out of breath, was present and gave report of the events that had taken place. My first view of Jake was with Major Hilton running down the hall with my buddy in his arms. He was pale-white and blood flowed from his wound down the Major’s camouflage colored scrubs. Jake’s arms and legs hung towards the floor; gravity was in control of his body and there was no purposeful movement.</p>
<p>Immediately, he was set on the operating table and all of his clothes were quickly cut off with trauma shears. The OR nurse opened a full bottle of Betadine (an antiseptic solution) onto his body to prevent infection because there was no time to prepare our patient using standard surgical procedures. The dark red mixture mixed with Jake’s blood and dripped onto the floor. It was difficult to tell which was the blood or Betadine. The temperature of the room was a fierce 100 degrees to prevent cooling of our patient’s body. While I placed a large IV into Jake’s left arm, Dr. Hilton began to make an incision near Jake’s heart. Our anesthetist intubated Jake and ventilated his lungs gaining control of Jake’s respirations, trying to give the soldier some oxygen. A dark blood began to creep outward from the surgeon’s incision, and as the scalpel reached Jake’s chest, a gush of bright red blood exploded onto the floor; portions of lung and cardiac tissue littered the operating room.</p>
<p>All monitors placed on Jake showed no movement or human activity. Dr. Hilton, as collected a man he was, quietly said “stop” and left the room. I was horrified, fixated at the sight of my naked friend, dead in front of me. He had tattoos on his chest and his green eyes were hazy. Jake was laying on the operating room table. His arms were each spread and his legs were together. It reminded me of the story of Jesus on the cross, giving his life to save another. In a way, he did. That life would be mine later on. The Betadine mixed with blood continued to drip off of the table and soaked the floor while the smell of iron combined with the heat of the thick air made me nauseous. A bloody trail of footprints circled around his body and towards the operating room exit. As I cleaned the blood off of my equipment, the Chaplain arrived to say a prayer over our fallen friend. The night wasn’t over. I would still need to help the others clean the operating room and mop the blood and tissue off of the floor.</p>
<p>As we covered his body, I thought about his family at home and wondered what they were doing at this time. The family was not aware of the events taking place and would soon be greeted by soldiers in the Army’s Dress Blue Uniform informing them the status of their child and fiancé. I was lightheaded, my arms shook from the adrenaline flowing through my veins. When we finished, I left the operating room to get a breath of the cold mountain air. I walked out of the building through a mass of soldiers wondering why we were leaving the operating room so soon. I stepped out behind the building and behind some connexes where days before I’d incinerated a leg, fell to my knees, and wept.</p>
<p>When I finished a minute or two later, I walked back inside. His friends were waiting outside the hospital and we circled together, cried, and became one to celebrate the life of a wonderful man. The cold January weather appropriately mimicked the attitude we felt towards the enemy and many of these men were bloodthirsty for revenge.</p>
<p>Later that evening, a tribute was made to Jake. Each soldier on the FOB lined up in two lines. Jake received one last salute from each man and woman and his body was carried in a casket to a Blackhawk. It would be a swift journey back home to Kentucky.</p>
<p>I hope this means something to someone. It’s kind of a lot, but then again I tend to reflect around Memorial Day.</p>
<p>If you, for any reason, feel like contacting me. You can do so from this site.</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>
