Ok, pun intended?

```errorist``` is a super easy to use package. The whole point is that we're copy/pasting everything into Chrome as it is, why not have the computer do it for you?


```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(errorist)
enable_errorist()
print(hello)
```


While useful, I can also see how this might start to get annoying.
